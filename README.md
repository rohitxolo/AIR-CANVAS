# AIR-CANVAS
ðŸŽ¨ Air Canvas â€“ Draw in the Air Using Hand Gestures âœ‹âœ¨ Air Canvas is an interactive digital drawing tool that allows users to draw in the air using hand gestures. Built with OpenCV, MediaPipe, and ML, it detects hand movements and converts them into real-time strokes on a virtual canvas. No physical contact required!

ðŸ”¥ Features
âœ… Gesture-Based Drawing â€“ Use your fingers to draw, erase, and control the canvas.
âœ… Hand Tracking with OpenCV & MediaPipe â€“ Accurate and fast hand detection.
âœ… Multiple Colors & Brush Sizes â€“ Switch colors and adjust stroke thickness dynamically.
âœ… Eraser Mode â€“ Easily remove unwanted strokes.
âœ… AI-Powered Enhancements â€“ (Optional) Add predictive smoothing or gesture shortcuts.

ðŸš€ Tech Stack
Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe for hand tracking
Machine Learning for gesture recognition (optional)
NumPy, Tkinter (or PyQt) for UI enhancements
ðŸŽ¯ Future Improvements
Implement voice commands for additional control.
Add multi-touch support for advanced interactions.
Optimize for AR/VR integration.
